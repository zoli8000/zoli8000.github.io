Loading

Insert the program into your c64/c128/emulator.
Type load ”*”,8,1 and when finished type run.

The game

Dazzling city is growing rapidly. New skyscrapers emerge from 
dust day by day.
As a contractor you have just signed a contract to demolish
an old building. If you fulfill at least 90% of cleaning, you
will be awarded with a new contract on a new site, a 
maximum of five.
You have carefully analized the building, and created  a
color map, which shows what your wrecking ball will achieve 
with a hit. You can hit the building if there is at least one another
matching color in the four directions.
The more matching colors there are, the more you progress.

Controls

	‹ ^ › ¡ 	precision aim for wrecking ball
	1 2 3 4 5	repaint current block with the given color
	space		hit with the wrecking ball
	return		finish current site – 
				if below 90%, game over, otherwise move to
				next site

Gameplay 
Every pixels cleared helps you to fulfill your contract.
However, only two or more of the same color will increase 
your score.
The formula used for scoring is (p-2)*(p-1), where p is the 
number of adjacent pixels of the same color.
So a hit of 2 pixels mean no score added, 3 pixels mean a score of 2,
and 20 pixels mean 380.
When the wrecking ball works, the aim cursor becomes red
until it finishes its job, signing it with the cursor becoming
white again.
Every site you receive one ’repaint’, which can help you in 
tough situations, or y0ou can use it to reach really high scores.


End game

You finish the site with pressing return – if you progressed
over 90%, and you are not on site 5, you move to the next site.
You receive the progress percentage of the current site score.
After the fifth site you retire with the money earned.
It you are below 90%, you retire as well – a better contractor
receives the job.
If you start a new game, you will move to a new city with
different buildings.
Every game starts with the same buildings, which
means you can compete with your friends on the same levels.
If you would like some random challenge, restart the game
with pressing return a few times.
